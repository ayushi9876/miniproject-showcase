# üß¨ Blood Group Detection Using Fingerprints

A deep learning-based system that classifies human blood groups (A, B, AB, O) using fingerprint biometrics. This project explores a **non-invasive**, **automated**, and **cost-effective** alternative to traditional blood testing by leveraging computer vision and deep learning.
